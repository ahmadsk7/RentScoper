## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**

   - The Python scraper collects rental listings from Craigslist
   - Data is saved to JSON files with timestamps
   - Historical data is maintained for trend analysis

2. **Data Processing**

   - Listings are aggregated by location
   - Average prices are calculated
   - Data is formatted for visualization

3. **Visualization**
   - Interactive bar chart shows price trends
   - Color intensity indicates price ranges
   - Easy-to-read labels and price tags

## Future Enhancements

- Price drop alerts
- Filtering by price range and location

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
